# Ethereum Node Setup and Configuration

#### Set up an Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) Client
- Deploy both the Execution Layer and Consensus Layer using recommended
best practices.
- You may use a cloud environment or a local machine for this setup.
#### Provide a Postman Collection
-  Include the top 10 RPC endpoints that are functional with the deployed Ethereum PoS client.

#### Document the Setup Process
- Include all configuration details, resource requirements, and steps taken.

#### Design a Monitoring and Alert System
- Document how you would implement a monitoring and alerting mechanism to
ensure the RPC node operates reliably in a production-grade environment.

#### Build a Simple RPC Node Monitoring Tool
- Develop a lightweight monitoring tool or script (in Python, TypeScript, or Go)that checks the health and state of the RPC node and logs metrics at regular intervals.
